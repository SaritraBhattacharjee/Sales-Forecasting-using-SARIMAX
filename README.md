                                                       SALES FORECASTING USING SARIMAX
                                                       






Developed a SARIMAX model to forecast monthly sales for the next 24 months. Preprocessed data by converting date indices, filling missing values, and ensuring stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) with p-value analysis. Incorporated both trend and seasonality. Evaluated model accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE (~9%).
